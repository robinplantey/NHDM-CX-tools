# CX-tools

CX-tools is a Mathematica package written during my PhD for detecting Custodial Symmetry (CS) and order-2 CP 
symmetry in multi-Higgs-doublet models (NHDM) potentials in an arbitrary doublet basis. With this package, the 
algorithms 
introduced in the papers 

- [Computable conditions for order-2 CP symmetry in NHDM potentials](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02004) 
- []()

can be implemented.

This code is mainly intended as a demonstration, although it is commented and, with a good grasp of the papers above, 
may be used to identify CS or CP2 symmetries of any potential. It is recommended to study the examples if you 
intend to use this code. If all else fails, feel free to contact me and I may be able to provide some guidance.
